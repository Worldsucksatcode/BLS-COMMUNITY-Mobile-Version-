	<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px; color: orangered;">How did we come here?</h3>
	<p  class="para">BLS COMMUNITY was created on 17 August 2022 by me ofc! it was just an ordinary group but,unlike the others it did <spam>NOT</spam> die. it kept on growing.even though some random nerds tried to change it but...whatever!. currently this is the largest group of STD V! maybe in the whole school having 85+ members. some random day it even reached 112+! </p>
	<h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px;"><spam style="color: green;">Rol</spam><spam style="color: red;">es</spam></h2>
	<p  class="para"style="text-align: left"><spam style="color: crimson;">NOONE:</spam> A <spam>NOONE</spam> is for punishment purposes only.a person will be a noone if he breaks a rule for which he doesnt deserve to get banned but deserves to get a kind of punishment.So, if a person is noone he will not be able to talk,vote on poll,do <spam style="color: red";>ANYTHING</spam>in the group.even if he votes on poll or something it wont count.so he will just spectate the whole group.it is a responsibility for a admin and permanant admin to make sure that the noone says a <spam style="color: red;">SINGLE</spam>word</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">MEMBER:</spam> a member is a ordinary person in the group.he has no task or something and all he will do is just having fun.</spam></p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">MEDIC:</spam>a medic is a person whose Job is to add people  if a person gets banned there job will be to add them back . They also have to add people if the owner says so.the medics are normally very neutral:). they are loved by most of the members. but sometimes due to the owners pressure the medics have to choose violance. each medic have a <spam style="
	color: red"> SPECIAL SUPERPOWER</spam> the medics all have 5 special knife. if the owners forces them to chose violance then they will use it.by using the special knife the doctor can ban a person for not 1...not 2 but <spam style="color: red;">3 WHOLE MONTHS</spam> but...it gets even crazier! if a doctor uses that knife without the permission of the owner then the people who got banned will be banned <spam style="color:red;">FOREVER!</spam>. also the special knife can be used on the owner.the owner will just be an noone if the special knife affects him. but the story doesnt end their!so only time will tell what will happen... a doctor can use its banned sword by typing the words "/use special_knife on {player_name}. to be an doctor u have to sub to my channel from 7 accounts minimum</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color:red;">SHERIFFF:</spam> a sheriff is a person whose job is kinda...intresting tbh.his kinda like the secrent agent.so, if a admin permanant admin and others does something sneaky then the sherifff will find that guy and eliminate him! (a.k.a disadmin, being a noone or just removed) good luck being a sheriff cuz it is tricky! the sherifff also have to eliminate the doctor if he uses the special sword. but if the sheriff also gets eliminated then a special force has to save it all. to become a sheriff u gotta act like ur the chosen one or...just sub to my channel from 4 accounts</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color:red;">CLOWN:</spam> a clown is a person whose job is to entertain ppl.a member will most likely be a clown first...But u might be wondering... why should i entertain ppl? well were gonna find that answer later.unlike the other roles the clown would never choose violance and... the owner would never force them to.There is no special power for the clown.</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">FLEX ADMINS:</spam>a flex admin is literally just like the member.there only made admins so that they can flex.SHAME OF U MAN FLEXING IS HARAM >:(. a person can be an flex admin if they get enough points</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">ADMINS:</spam>An admin is kinda ordinary. Their job is to make sure no members break any rule.U can be an admin if u sub to my YT channel from 5 accounts or,he can be an good clown and get enough points to be a admin.If u wanna know what does points mean well were gonna talk about that later.also if a member breaks rules then the admins have to inform it to the owner. Also admins can't change anything in the group.they can remove people  if they break rules but can't add them</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">PERMANANT ADMINS:</spam>A permanent admin is just like the admin,the difference is they cannot be disadmined.A person can be admin if they sub to my channel from 13 accounts OR, get enough points. There can be only 5 permanant admins.There job of them is to make sure that the admins dont break Rules.if they do then they have to inform it to the owner.The permanant admins can also change things in the group but...they first need to inform it to the owners.if anyone tries to rebel against the owner then the permanant admins have to delete all of their messages but... if it goes too far then they have to make those persons nooone or just remove them.</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">CO-OWNER:</spam>A CO-OWNER is just like the owner.the difference is...he didnt actually create the group.he gets the same power as the owner.But... the co-owner can be a temporary owner if the rael owners says so. the current co-owner is KAYSAN and u can also be the co-owner by 2 ways.</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">1)</spam>BIDDING: so for example we have 2 people here. player 1 and player 2. and they want to buy a thing which cost 30$. player one says that he will buy it for 40$.but player 2 decides to buy it for 50$.and this will keep on going. until... suppose now, player 1 says he will buy it for 200$.but player 2 says that he will buy it for 300$.the seller realized that 200$ is enough so, he gives it to player 2.so bidding means buyers bidding on the item and,the seller finally giving it to one of the buyers after he thinks that the price is good enough.but here the currency isnt $ its subsssss. currently co-owner bidding is off </p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">1)</spam>GETTING POINTS: if u wanna be co-owner then u have to get enough points.but this only can be done if the current co-owner leaves.</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">OWNER:</spam>A owner is the creater of the group.He controls everything in the group.but unlike the other roles he actually doesnt have any job (Kinda).</p>
	<h4 style="font-size: 50px;">CURRENCY</h4>
	<p class="para">Just like the other countries BLS COMMUNITY have currencies too!!!! well lets check them!</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">SUBS (SUBSCRIPTION):</spam>subscription are kinda p2w but...if u really want easy paths then lemme explain.Now,subscriptions are just the amount of subs that u give to the owners channel WORLDYT.if u want the link then just DM the owner which is me :). now unlike other p2w options,subscription can give u a little more advantage.like better relationship with the owner and etc.BUT if u dont want to give me subscribtion (which is really painful for me and i think u should give me those subs) dont worry!cuz the 2nd option is...</p>
	<p class="para"><spam style="color: red;">POINTS:</spam>So, points are a bittt grindy but if u wont give me those subs then...this is ur only choise blud.So, the first step is member and... how to get points if ur a member? well...if u type something then u will get 2 points.if u vote on a poll u also get 2 points.if u HOST a poll then u get 5 points. if u vote on an event then u can get those sweet 3 points but HOSTING it will give u 10. and the most easiest of them all is, if u send a pic or video u get 20 points.But i aint making this easy for ya >:). u see there is a countdown... and its based on the points u get.the task u do which give u more points=the rise of the countdown. so, if u do something which gives u 2 points (which is chatting) u will get ur next 2 points in 2 mins.Now,it doesnt mean u cant chat,U CAN but it will not give u the points.for voting on a poll= 2MIN 50SEC countdown for hosting a poll=5 hours of countdown for participating on a event= 3hours of countdown for hosting it= 10 hours of countdown. AND FINALLY for sending a video or a photo= 3 days of countdown.NOW THIS IS CALLED GRINDY! now, by getting those points u can upgrade ur role.The first option is flex admin which cost 100 points.The second option is a CLOWN which cost 300 points.and also i just wanna let u know that i cant really count ur points so u have to memorize them by urself.then after getting the required points just tell me which role u wanna upgrade to. I will 100% say YES!so, how to get points if ur a flex admin? well...there kinda the same as members but,the points will double so as the countdown.NOW, how to get points if ur a clown? simple, if u make 1 people laugh: 20 points and 10h of cooldown. if u make 2 people laugh: 30 points and 24h of cooldown. if u make more then 2 people laugh= 50 points and 48h of cooldown.now from here u have 2 options. 1) become a sheriff cost: 500 points and, 2)become a medic: 700 points. now, to get points as a sheriff, if any ppl of the group (except me) does something sneaky and, if the sheriff finds out who is doing it and eliminates him then, he will get a whopping 2000 points with 3days countdown. and if he eliminates the medic using the specia$ K#@DB then he will get 10K points!.BUT there is a catch...u see things like this happens to rarely that in the history of BLSCOMMUNITY it only happend <spam style="color: red;">ONCE</spam>even though u can do some sidequests it will still take FOREVER to rank up from here (unless u sub to my channel :)))).So, if u want a safer option then medic is perfect for u.to get points as a medic, if the medic adds 1 people then he will get 100 points with,30h of countdown. if he adds 2 people then 200 points with 50h of countdown.if u add 2+ people then 500 points with 100h of countdown.from here u can go rank up to become an admin which costs 1500 points. to earn points if ur an admin u gotta make sure noone breaks any rules. each day u will get 20 points if u do that with 0 countdown.BUT, if u caught a member breaking the rules and u punish him by making him a noone or just removing him, then u will get 1000 points with 24h countdown. and if the you delete an noones message then u will get 10 points.if u wanna be an permanant admin it will cost u 5000 points.Getting points as an permanant admin is just like the admin but, everything will be doubled even the countdown.to be an co-owner u have to make sure that there is no co-owner.even after that it will take u 50000 points to be one.yea i think u should definitly sub to my channel.btw there no way to be an owner sorry blud!</p>
